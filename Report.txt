This project creates and plays a game of blackjack for up to eight people, by running the blackjack class and giving it the commandline argument of a file in the style of game1.txt (with player name and money), and an optional second argument that indicates if a player should be the dealer (by typing in dealer). If there is no second commandline argument, the dealer will be controlled by an AI. Every player has the chance to bet before the round begins. Every turn of the player's, the dealer's hand and the player's hand are shown, and the player can decide to hit, double, or stay. The player can double on their first turn, thus ending their turn,or hit until they choose not to or their hand exceeds 21. The deck is stored in a queue, where the first card is pulled and placed into the participant's hand during the deal phase and when the participant chooses to hit. The queue makes the running of the deck significantly more efficient, with dealing a card taking constant time. Players and the dealer are both subclasses of the superclass participant. Both players and dealers share many characteristics, such as a name,money, hand, and handvalue, and some of the same methods (hit, printhand, printlastcard), as well as getters for the variables. Dealers have the added capability to take money from players (during a win), have their first card dealt facedown, and can flip their first card faceUp. Players can bet money, double,and can win or tie their game, as well as having getters and setters for bet and variable win. Inheritance allows for the similarities between the player and the dealer to be more efficiently instantiated.
